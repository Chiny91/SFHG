# SFHG
### *Script to read SFHG quarterly magazine archive under MacOS*

*Programmer and USB stick producer notes*

Mods to WebKit probably in 2019 have made it default behaviour on all browswers not to permit file:// to access other file:// URLs.

MacOS could work around this by:
Tweaking system preferences (weaken security ?)
Or running a local web server, selected.

SFHG USB stick is produced on a Windows machine, which does not permit file attribute "Execute"
