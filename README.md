# SFHG
### *Script to read SFHG quarterly magazine archive under MacOS*

*Programmer notes*

Mods to WebKit probably in 2019 have made it default behaviour on most browsers not to permit file:// to access other file:// URLs.   MacOS could work around this by tweaking system preferences (weakens security ?) or by running a local web server, as in this script.

The SFHG USB stick is produced on a Windows machine, which does not permit file attribute "Execute".   Workaround is to use ZIPping for Windows USB stick production, with the unZIPping done on a Mac.
